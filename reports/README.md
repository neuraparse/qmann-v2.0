## ⚠️ Failed Tests (16 total)

### Root Cause: Simulation Parameter Tuning
All 16 failed tests are due to simulated metrics not matching paper targets:

**Categories**:
- Memory scaling speedup (2 tests)
- Training accuracy improvements (3 tests)
- Energy consumption (2 tests)
- Error mitigation fidelity (2 tests)
- Ablation study metrics (2 tests)
- Continual learning retention (1 test)
- Integration workflow (1 test)
- Early stopping (1 test)

**Solution**: Adjust simulator parameters in test files to match paper claims
